## Instructions

## CurrencyPal

## 1. Problem Statement

Our company needs a tool to be able to quickly send or recieve various currencies.

## 2. Top Questions to Resolve in Review

1. Extra features?
2. How are we going to structure our database?
3. 

## 3. Use Cases

U1. As a CurrencyPal customer I want to `quickly and effieciently find exchange rates` when I `know the set amount I would like to exchange`

U2. As a CurrencyPal customer, I want to view all transaction history

U3. As a CurrencyPal customer, I want to view the history of each currency to predict trends

U4. As a CurrencyPal customer, I want to look up transaction history by name/customerID.

U5. As a CurrencyPal customer, I want to be able to create a transaction, where I convert my money from one currency to another.

U6. As a CurrencyPal customer, I want to be able to send other users money in whatever currency I choose to convert it too.

U7. As a CurrencyPal customer, customer, I want to view the transaction history by currency.

U8. As a CurrencyPal customer, I want to send myself an alert when currencies reach a certain rate.

## 4. Project Scope


### 4.1. In Scope

Getting the most current currency exchange rates
View the history of a currency's exchange rate
Be able to exchange currency and update personal balance
View transaction history by currency
View transaction history by user
View all transaction history

### 4.2. Out of Scope

The ability to send and request money
The ability to let users create individual accounts
The ability to send alerts to users

# 5. Proposed Architecture Overview
This initial iteration will provide the minimum lovable product (MLP) including the ability to view currency exchange rates, execute exchanges, and viewing transaction history through various filters.

We will use API Gateway and Lambda to create *INSERT NUMBER HERE* endpoints (*INSERT ENDPOINTS HERE*) that will handle the creation, updating and retrieval of our transactions and exchange rates.

We will retrieve the initial exchange rates from [freecurrencyapi](https://freecurrencyapi.com/) and store those in a table in DynamoDB.  We will then reference that table whenever we do our conversions.  We will have a button on our website for our users to use to update the rates to their most current state.  The button will use our DynamoDB table if it has been less then 12 hours otherwise it will use our API endpoints to update the exchange rates (Updating to an automated scheduler is currently out of scope).

We will be using tables in DynamoDB to store all of our transaction history and our customer data.

[See PlantUML](currencyConverterCD.puml) for more details.


# 6. API

## 6.1. Public Models

_Define the data models your service will expose in its responses via your *`-Model`* package. These will be equivalent to the *`PlaylistModel`* and *`SongModel`* from the Unit 3 project._
```
// CurrencyModel

double currentRate;
Currencies currency;
CountryName countryName;
int ranking;

// TransactionModel

String transactionId;
Currency currency;
Customer customer;
double amountToConvert;
boolean isShown;
```


## 6.2. Get Currency Endpoint
* Accepts `GET` requests to `/currency/:currencyDAO`
* Accepts the currency  and returns currentRate.
    * If the given currency is not found, will throw a
      `CurrencyNotFoundException`

We don't require anything, we are using https://api.freecurrencyapi.com/v1/latest to populate our database of currencies and respective excahnge rates.

## 6.3. Update Currency Endpoint
* Accepts `PUT` requests to `/currency/:currencyDAO`
* Accepts data to update a Currency, including the updated double currentRate, Currency enum, CountryName enum, and int ranking
  * if the currency name is not found, will throw a `CurrencyNotFoundException`
## 6.4. Get Transaction Endpoint
* Accepts `GET` requests to `/transaction/:transactionId`
* Accepts a transactionId and returns the corresponding Transaction
   * if the transactionId is not found return `TransactionNotFoundException`

## 6.3. Create Transaction Endpoint
* Accepts a `POST` request to `/transaction/:transactionId`
* Accepts the data to create a new transaction with a provided Currency, CustomerId, AmountToConvert, and IsShown.  Returns a new transaction including a unique transactionId generated by CurrencyPal.

## 6.3. Update Transaction Endpoint
* Accepts a `PUT` request to `/transaction/:transactionId`
* Accepts data to update a Transaction, inlcuding the updated isShown, transactionId, Currency, Customer, and amountToConvert.
*   if the transactionId is not found return `TransactionNotFoundException`
